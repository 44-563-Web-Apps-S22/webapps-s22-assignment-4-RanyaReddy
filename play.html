    <h3> SCENE XVI (Monsieur Jourdain, Dorimene, Dorante, Lackey) </h3>
    
<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>:<p>(After having made two bows, finding himself too
near Dorimene) A little farther, Madame.</p>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>:<p>What?</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>:<p> One step, if you please.</p>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>: <p>What is it?</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>: <p>Step back a little for the third.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>:<p>Madame, Monsieur Jourdain is very knowledgeable.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>:<p> Madame, it is a very great honor to me to be<br>
fortunate enough to be so happy as to have the joy that you should<br>
have had the goodness to accord me the graciousness of doing me the<br>
honor of honoring me with the favor of your presence; and, if I<br>
also had the merit to merit a merit such as yours, and if<br>
Heaven... envious of my luck... should have accorded me... the<br>
advantage of seeing me worthy... of the...</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>Monsieur Jourdain, that is enough. Madame doesn't like<br>
grand compliments, and she knows that you are a man of wit. (Aside<br>
to Dorimene) As you can see, this good bourgeois is ridiculous<br>
enough in all his manners.</p>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>:<p> It isn't difficult to see it.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>Madame, he is the best of my friends.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>: <p>You do me too much honor.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>A completely gallant man.</p>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>: <p>I have great esteem for him.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>: <p>I have done nothing yet, Madame, to merit this
favor.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>(Aside to Monsieur Jourdain) Take care, nonetheless, to
say absolutely nothing to her about the diamond that you gave her.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6> : <p>Can't I even ask her how she likes it?</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>What? Take care that you don't. That would be loutish of<br>
you; and, to act as a gallant man, you must act as though it were<br>
not you who made her this present. (Aloud) Monsieur Jourdain,<br>
Madame, says he is delighted to see you in his home.<br>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>: <p>He honors me greatly.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>: <p>How obliged I am to you, sir, for speaking thus
to her for me!</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>I have had frightful trouble getting her to come here.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>:<p> I don't know how to thank you enough.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>He says, Madame, that he finds you the most beautiful
woman in the world.</p>

<h6>DORIMENE</h6>: <p>He does me a great favor.</p>

<h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</h6>: <p>Madame, it is you who does the favors, and...</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>Let's consider eating.</p>

<h6>LACKEY</h6>: <p>Everything is ready, sir.</p>

<h6>DORANTE</h6>: <p>Come then let us sit at the table. And bring on the
musicians.</p>

(Six cooks, who have prepared the feast, dance together and make
the third interlude; after which, they carry in a table covered
with many dishes.)
